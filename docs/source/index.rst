Welcome to Deep-LASI's documentation!
===================================

**Deep-LASI** (/dēp'lā-zē/) is a MATLAB program using Python libraries
for automatized, multi-color single molecule data analysis.

Deep-LASI – Deep-Learning Assisted Single-Molecule Imaging analysis provides a tool 
for imaging processing and automated, unbiased analysis of single-molecule data.
Deep-LASI comprises a collection of methods to characterize single molecule data 
with up to 3 channels in an automated fashion. The algorithms provided are routinely 
used to analyze data arising from multi-color single-molecule TIRF and Confocal data. 
Deep-LASI is based on the program TRacer, dedicated to finding single molecules, 
colocalizing molecules between different imaging channels, and extracting their fluorescence 
signatures depending on the excitation and detection scheme. The downstream analysis of 
single-molecule traces can be carried out manually as well as automatically using advanced 
deep-learning-assisted methods. Deep-LASI allows determining correction factors required for 
accurate FRET measurements and concomitantly distances between 2 up to 3 fluorophores.
Moreover, it identifies underlying conformational states and interconverting kinetics. 
Deep-LASI provides an architecture to process the initial raw data and summarize the analyzed 
data in final plots based on MATLAB and libraries using Python. Please cite the following 
papers if you use Deep-LASI in your own work, so we can continue development and support: 

Paper 1
Paper 2

Deep-LASI pulls data from the `Git-Hub database <https://github.com/NurAb-Sal/TRacer>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

To get started with Deep-LASI, please take a look at the :doc:`installation` guide and :doc:`tutorial`. 
Additional :doc:`example` galleries and reference material is provided in the :doc:`documentation` section. 

If you have any questions or problems, if you want to provide feedback about your experience
