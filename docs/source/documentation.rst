*Deep-LASI* comes with an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) to perform processing and analysis tasks during the data evaluation. This page serves for documenting its functionalities. *Deep-LASI* comes with six integrated GUI sub-windows for analyzing the data and one menubar for handling the data reading, the settings of the program, and simulating single-molecule data. The analysis-GUIs are dedicated to (1) opening and molecule identification, (2) mapping and trace extraction, (3) trace categorization, selection, trace correction/analysis, (4) SNR analysis of traces, (5) the summary of the results including FRET, States, correction factors and TDP plots, and (6) the classical HMM analysis via different software packages.

To start learning how to use *Deep-LASI*, we recommend, first, reading through the :doc:`starter` and :doc:`example` sections. 
A step-wise description of how to analyze different single-molecule data with *Deep-LASI* is given for selected showcases in the :doc:`example` in detail.
