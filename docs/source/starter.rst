    installed MATLAB and a working Python environment on your computer system. Alternatively,
    you can also use a MATLAB Runtime environment. You can find 
    a description of the individual, required installation steps in the :doc:`installation` guide.

    the MATLAB source code to the working folder of your Matlab installation. 

#.  Before running Deep-LASI the first time have a look into the :doc:`example`, which
    provides a step-wise description, how to load multi-color single-molecule data into the software.
    `Example Data <https://github.com/NurAb-Sal/TRacer>`_ is additionally provided together with the Software Download.
