How to get started
=====

#.  Before using Deep-LASI on your single-molecule data, first, make sure, you have an 
    installed MATLAB and a working Python environment on your computer system. Alternatively,
    you can also use a MATLAB Runtime environment. You can find 
    a description of the individually required installation steps in the :doc:`installation` guide.

#.  Next, download the Deep-LASI software package from the `Repository <https://github.com/NurAb-Sal/TRacer>`_ and/or add 
    the MATLAB source code to the working folder of your Matlab installation. 

#.  Before running Deep-LASI the first time, have a look at the :doc:`example`, which
    provides a step-wise description of how to load multi-color single-molecule data into the software.     
    Example data sets are additionally provided.

#. To follow the examples cases, download the corresponding example data and save/copy it to
    your analysis folder. The example data sets can be accessed from the `Repository <https://github.com/NurAb-Sal/TRacer>`_
