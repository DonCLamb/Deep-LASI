Dynamic 2c FRET Data
=====

The following part shows how to use Deep-LASI to analyze dynamic 2-color smFRET (single-molecule FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer) data measured with alternating laser excitation (ALEX). Deep-LASI provides you with the options of analyzing your data either automatically using the deep learning neural network or manually. The analysis usually starts with detecting the co-localized FRET pairs within the field of view from both cameras and extracting their intensity traces, followed by sorting the traces into helpful categories, and determining the correction factors. Aftrwards, you can continue the analysis steps for the kinetics of the sample system and visulaize the whole data on various plots and histograms.
