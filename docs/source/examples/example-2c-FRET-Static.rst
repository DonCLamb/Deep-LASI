Workflow for analyzing Static 2c FRET Data
=====

.. _example:

The following examples describes the workflow, when analyzing static smFRET (single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Tranfer) data with two labels, 
such as distance rulers based on double-stranded DNA labeled with two fluorophores. 

Deep-LASI provides a modular workflow for analysing the data, either manually or automatically. In the example below, we describe the workflow for two publicly available sample data sets published by from `Hellenkamp et al., Nat. Meth (2018) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0085-0>`_
and `Götz et al., Nat. Meth (2022) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33023-3>`_. The examples start with localization and and trace extraction of fluorescent molecules between both channels, the categorization process, the determination of correction factors, the selection of time windows to be analyzed per single time trace, the kinetic analysis, and ends with a summary of the analyzed traces by calculating the distribution of the correction factors, the FRET values as well as the stoichiometry.
