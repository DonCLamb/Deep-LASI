Plotting and fitting the results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After having traces categorized with selected regions on each trace, in order to plot various parameters and fitting the distributions, you can move on to the *Histograms* tab on the main GUI (:numref:`Histograms_tab`).

   The *Histograms* tab on the main-GUI of DeepLASI

As shown on :numref:`Histograms_tab_GUI`, the provided tab consists of several panels. The panel *Plots* displays any created graph(s), and in case of performing the fitting, also details of fitting results attached to the plot(s). The panel *Data Selection* shows the same categories created before with the number of traces on each category. On the section *Plot Mode*, you can choose the desired parameter to be plotted. The provided list of parameters includes apparent and corrected FRET efficiencies, detection efficiency correction factor (gamma), spectral crosstalk and direct excitation correction factors, and stoichiometry in the both apparent and corrected FRET efficiency cases.

   The *Histogram*-GUI of Deep-LASI has several sub-windows for plotting data and fitting

On the panel *Display Settings* one can choose how to show the results considering the various options provided for plotting and fitting ().
