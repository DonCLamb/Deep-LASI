Plotting and fitting the results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then you can move on to the **FRET** tab, and again choose the desired category by clicking on the plus sign beside the list.

   Choosing desired category(ies) on *FRET* tab

After choosing the category, you can select from the **Plot Mode** which plot to get. In the example shown on figure 26, you get the histogram of apparent FRET efficiency, like the one in figure 27.

There are options in **Display Settings** (see figure 28) to make the frame-wise and/or molecule-wise plot visible, normalize them, and also to fit them by choosing the best fitting method. If sometimes fitting seems so wrong, you can manually insert some values based on what you roughly see on the plot, fix them and fit again. By playing around the fitting gets better, then you can uncheck the fixing boxes and let the program find the best fitting values. You can also change the color of your plot(s) by clicking on the colored rectangle and choose a desired color.
