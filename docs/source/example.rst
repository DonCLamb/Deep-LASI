Deep-LASI can be employed for different single-molecule assays. Below we provide a short intro how get start and
to use Deep-LASI for the different data formats. Please click on the different images to visit the corresponding
example pages. 

One-color assays
==================

Single-color bleaching step analysis
------------

In many experiments, the labeling efficiency or number of binding partners can be determined by bleaching step analysis, 
i.e. by counting the number of intensity levels and determining the number of time spend in the different niveaus.

PAINT: Dwell time analysis
------------

In DNA-PAINT, fluorescently labeled *imager* strands transiently bind to complementary *docking* strands on a target structure. 
Upon hybridization to the target, an increase in fluorescence intensity (ON-state) is observed while the imager strand is bound for the time τ :sub:`b`.
After dissociation, the docking strand is unoccupied (OFF-state) and no fluroescence is observed during the time τ :sub:`d`. Besides sequence-based multiplexing, variation of binding time and binding frequency allow for visualizing multiple distinct molecular species within a single sample via DNA-PAINT. Deep-LASI allows for extracting time traces and fluorescence characteristics, to determine the ON- and OFF-times 
according to the chosen DNA sequence.
